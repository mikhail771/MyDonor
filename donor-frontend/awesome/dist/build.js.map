В Украине меньше доноров, чем должно было бы быть для того, чтобы покрывать нужды больниц в любой ситуации. Спрос крови непредсказуем и даже отличается с каждым типом крови. Например O‐ кровь может назначаться пациентам со всеми типами крови. AB+ подходит только для пациентов с АВ+.</p>\r\n        <p>Срок хранения различных компонентов крови небольшой: эритроцитов, или суспензии красных кровяных телец, – примерно 35 дней; тромбоцитов, или кровяных пластинок, – семь дней, а свежезамороженной плазмы – до трех лет.

Именно для\r\n            этого донору рекомендуют\r\n            придерживаться диеты.

течение 2-х часов.\r\n            После кроводачи донору рекомендуется\r\n            отдохнуть 15 минут, набраться сил.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>        В этот день рекомендуют не заниматься\r\n

 эритроцитарную массу, которую можно\r\n            хранить в специальном холодильнике в\r\n            течение 21-35-42 дней в зависимости\r\n            от консерванта.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>        Параллельно с процессом\r\n            центрифугирования, кровь в лаборатории\r\n            еще раз проверяют на группу крови и\r\n            резус-фактор, тестируют на инфекции,\r\n            передающиеся через кровь, делают\r\n            биохимический и общий анализы крови.\r\n            Если не выявят противопоказаний\r\n            анализы, кровь после обработки смогут\r\n
